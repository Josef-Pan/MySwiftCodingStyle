# MySwiftCodingStyle
Code snippet to demonstrate my Swift coding style only
Original code was from https://www.appcoda.com/macos-programming/
I did lots of refactors to make it more readable and much clearer in terms of logic.
  1) All "if else" statements are replaced by early return of function or ternary statements
  2) "if let" statements are replaced by guard let
  3) "for" loops are replaced by forEach if possible
  4) functions are categorized and can be folded easily
